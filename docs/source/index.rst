Capybara
========

Capybara helps you test web applications by simulating how a real user would
interact with your app. It is agnostic about the driver running your tests and
comes with Selenium support built in.

_`Key benefits`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **No setup** necessary for WSGI-compliant applications. Works out of the box.
- **Intuitive API** which mimics the language an actual user would use.

_`Setup`
~~~~~~~~

To install, add ``capybara-py`` to your application's test requirements.
